title: NOAA Storm Data Analysis
---

This was a homework in Data Science course by JHU in Coursera. So have a refresh of R as well.

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. 
Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a 
key concern.  

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks 
characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of 
any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.  

This data analysis will address the following questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
