title: Neo4j study - A Tool for Entity-Relationship (Ontology) Data Model
---

So when talking about data models in the context of data curation, we know there are three main types: relational model, tree model
and Entity-Relationship (ER) model.  

We're all familar with the first two models and tools to deal with them. But not for ER model. It's easy to understand the concept
but rarely you can find as many discussions about tools and applications. This also seems to be a missing part in Data Curation lecture
in UIUC.  

So here we go, in this study I'll try to take a look at Neo4j graph database, cypher query language and Neo4j Python/Spark API.  

TBD
