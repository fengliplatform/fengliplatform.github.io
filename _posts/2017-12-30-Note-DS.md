title: A High Level Note to Data Science Process
---

Looking back for all the studies in past year, here comes a high level understanding/summary to the Data Science process -  where how far we've gone and we'll start in next year.  

#### Stage 1: Business Goal Understanding
1.1 what is the problem?  
1.2 what is the goal?  
1.3 how can you use data analytics to achieve the goal?  

#### Stage 2: Data Aquire
2.1 what kinds of data are needed?  
2.2 what data you have and what you don't?  
2.3 how to identify data sources, collect and integrate data?  

#### Stage 3: Data Preparation
3.1 exploratory
- stats (mean, median, max, min, skewness, kurtosis etc.)   
- Viz  (hist, scatter, box, bar, line, heatmap etc.)   

3.2 pre-process
- data clean (missing, duplicate, invalid, outlier etc.)   
- feature engineering (add, remove, combining, breaking etc.)   
- transformation (scaling, normalization, dimentionality reduction etc.)  

#### Stage 4: Data Analysis
4.1 select analytic approaches  
4.2 build models  
4.3 assess results  

#### Stage 5: communicate results, feedback, improvements  

#### Stage 6: apply results, feedback, improvements   

And of cause, the whole process consists of iterative cycles of each stage.
