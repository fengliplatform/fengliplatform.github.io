title: NLP with R (part 1): Word Cloud
---

So this is part 1 of DS course capstone project by JHU in Coursera.

We'll start with downloading the text data from [SwiftKey link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)
. The data includes blogs, news and twitters text files. They are available in multiple languages but We’ll only deal with the data files 
in English.Then I’ll analyze the data using text mining and NLP approaches to discover the structure in the data and how words are put 
together. After that, I’ll be building a predictive text model to predict the most likely next word. Finally, I’ll create a data product 
using shiny app (covered in part 2).  

In this note, we’ll do 
#### Some basic summaries to blog, news and twitter data files in en_US directory.  
* line count plot

#### Some basic plots to illustrate features of the data.
