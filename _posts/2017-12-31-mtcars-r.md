title: Take a quick look at MPG using box plot, t-test and build a regression model
---

This project assumes that you work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set (mtcars from datasets 
library) of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) 
(outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”  
* “Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions”  

The purpose of this project report is to address above two questions use the knowledge from course 7 regression models.  

Can you draw any conclusion from following plot for the first question?

Statistical analysis (t-test) for the second question and more can be [found on RPubs](http://rpubs.com/fengliplatform/262307)
